## Terraform .gitignore file 

This file will ignore 
1. Local .terraform directories
2. .tfstate files
3. Crash log files
4. Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as password, private keys, and other secrets
5. Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so are not checked in
6. Ignore CLI configuration files
